You noticed that I created two repositories in the past; I have been experimenting with AI models and APIs models. I practiced working with ChatGPT, BERT, and DeepSeek API. Each model has its own limitations and strengths. Not to mention, each API implemented in python is best suited for specific programming functions. 
For instance, DeepSeek is well-suited for programs where users ask questions and the AI provides intelligent answers based on specific data analysis. That said, this project like the previous one is focused on AI-generated summary reports. As with any model, each API has its limitations unless you are using a paid subscription.
For example, the DeepSeek API only allows a specific number of tokens and a limited portion of paragraphs. This is why the output sometimes appears to have words cut off. The free version is not sufficient for generating long summaries, and upgrading to a paid plan is essential for more results.
In addition, DeepSeek is a powerful API, but it also requires strong hardware. In my case, generating output took around 15 minutes or higher to complete.

CLIMATE CHANGE SAFE OPERATIONS MINIMIZING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT We take our responsibility to manage our operations in a way that minimises our environmental impact seriously. We are committed to minimising our greenhouse gas emissions and reducing our energy consumption. We have implemented a number of energy efficiency measures to improve our energy use, including installing LED lighting, upgrading our heating and cooling systems, and optimising our building controls. We also encourage our employees to adopt sustainable practices and to reduce their own carbon footprint. We have implemented a number of initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint, including promoting the use of public transport and car-sharing, encouraging the use of electric vehicles, and implementing a bike-sharing scheme. We also offset our unavoidable emissions through the purchase of carbon credits. CLIMATE

Climate change has become one of the most pressing global challenges of our time, with a significant impact on the environment, economy, and society. The oil and gas industry, as one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, has a critical role to play in addressing this challenge.
One of the ways to minimize the impact of climate change is to adopt cleaner and more efficient technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is where the Shaybah Producing Facility comes in.
The Shaybah Producing Facility is an oil and gas field located in Saudi Arabia, and it is operated by the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco). The facility has a large installed capacity of 120,000 barrels per day

Moreover, it streamlines scenario that limits global warming to 1.5 C through stringent climate policies, planning, and monitoring for sustainable development. The Paris Agreement was a turning point in the global effort to combat climate change, as it recognizes the importance of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.
The future of the world is inextricably tied to our ability to address climate change. As a result, it is essential that we take immediate and decisive action to combat climate change, while also building resilience and adaptability to the impacts that are already being felt. This includes increasing energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy, investing in sustainable infrastructure, and improving our ability to forecast and respond to extreme weather events.

Climate change can no longer be perceived as a distant concern, but one that has significant impacts on our health, economies, and communities.
Environmental Justice and Climate Change
Environmental justice is a concept that highlights the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on historically marginalized communities. Many of these communities are located in low-income areas and have faced a greater burden of environmental and health risks for decades. Climate change exacerbates these risks, making the issue of environmental justice even more critical.
Climate change and environmental justice are closely related, as they both have a significant impact on the health and well-being of vulnerable populations. Climate change-related events, such as extreme weather events, can cause harm to the physical and mental health of individuals. For example, heatwaves can lead to heat-related

Global warming, also known as climate change, is a long-term increase in the overall temperature of the Earth’s climate system. It is primarily caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere, which trap heat and warm the planet.
The increased temperature can lead to a variety of negative impacts, including rising sea levels, more frequent and severe heatwaves, more intense hurricanes, and changes in precipitation patterns. These changes can have significant impacts on agriculture, water resources, human health, and the natural environment.
